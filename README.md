## Design 
To this project, we decided to work following the [Material Design guidelines](https://material.io/design). That decision bring us the possibility to save a lot of time in the design phase, a way to not re-invent the wheel but ensuring a consistent visual language and trusted user experience.

Another good reason to use that is there are a lot of projects using Material Design and have this knowledge, it’s a strength that every high-performance team has to have.
